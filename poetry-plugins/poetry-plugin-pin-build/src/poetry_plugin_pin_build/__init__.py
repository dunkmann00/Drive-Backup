        # 1) It seems that if a dependency is listed and then required again by
        # another dependency, it can get listed multiple times when extras are
        # involved. So if we depend on 'cryptography[ssh]', and
        # 'drive-backup-credentials' depends on 'cryptography', cryptography
        # will get listed twice. Since we don't want this, we check to see if a
        # dependency has already been added.
        # 2) In order to handle our own sets of extras, we need to process
        # through all the dependencies for no extras first, and then each
        # different extra group. When doing this, dependencies could be part of
        # multiple groups of extras and/or the original non extra group. To make
        # sure the markers turn out correct, we need to keep combining markers
        # instead of overwriting the.
